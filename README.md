# Warning! This repo has been made solely for education purposes. It is neither secure or a good source for JC implementation examples (as almost everything inside is not done properly). It is part of [PV204 Security Technologies course](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2020/PV204?lang=en)
Part of this project was scrutiny from another team - this is kept as unfixed open issues to prevent anyone from the slightest temptation to use this repo.

If you are interested in the course, the materials along with some recorded online lectures are so far publicly available on MUNI information system [here](https://is.muni.cz/el/fi/jaro2020/PV204/um/?lang=en).
